The notification is at the stage of public comments. The new notification is being brought in order to make the process more transparent and expedient by implementation of an online system, further delegation, rationalisation and standardisation of the process.<br /><br /><br />The new notification includes certain provisions which could end up diluting the EIA process, especially the public consultation aspect. It provides for a reduction of time period from 30 days to 20 days for the public to submit their responses during a public hearing for any application seeking environmental clearance. It also requires that the public hearing process be completed in 40 days compared to 45 days under the 2006 notification. The main reason stated for reducing the time is that it would become easy for new investments to complete the formality of EIA. <br /><br />The danger is that if adequate time is not given for the preparation of views, comments and suggestions to those who would be affected by the project, then such public hearings would not be meaningful. In the Samarth Trust Case, the Delhi high court had considered EIAs a part of participatory justice in which the voice is given to the voiceless and it is like a jan sunwai, where the community is the jury. <br /><br />Unless a public hearing is meaningful, the whole EIA process would lack transparency and credibility. The reduction of time would particularly pose a problem in those areas where information is not easily accessible or areas in which people are not that well aware of the process itself. As the Supreme Court has said in several judgements over the years, the time for making any representation should be adequate and if it is not, then it would be a violation of the principles of natural justice. <br /><br />Even though the notification provides for the dissemination of information relating to public hearings through newspapers (and where dissemination through newspapers is not possible then by beating of drums or through radio or TV), the problem still remains. The issue of concern here is not the notice for public hearing but the access to information on which the affected people need to comment.<br /><br />Suggestion-- rather than compromise on the time needed for gathering public opinion, the government should focus on bringing down the average delay of 238 days in granting environmental clearance. In Kerala, the administration took 1,049 days to clear the construction of the IT park project of M/s T Tech Park Ltd, instead of 105 days.</p>',

The notification is at the stage of public comments. The new notification is being brought in order to make the process more transparent and expedient by implementation of an online system, further delegation, rationalisation and standardisation of the process.<br /><br />The new draft notification has some serious problems, one of which is the extension of the time given for submitting a compliance report throughout the term of the project. <br /><br />The earlier notification required that the project proponent submit a report every six months, showing that they are carrying out their activities as per the terms on which permission has been given. However, the new notification requires the promoter to submit a report only once every year. During this period, certain irreversible environmental, social or health consequences of the project could go unnoticed because of the extended reporting time. For example, if a mining project is being carried out at some place which can be potentially hazardous to the nearby population and can contaminate the air, and water nearby, a half-yearly compliance report would better help in addressing these concerns. Any hazardous activity can then be stopped through timely reporting.<br /><br />However, providing a longer period for filing reports can lead to disastrous consequences. In such a situation, the concerned authority will not have the opportunity to question the promoters for not following the terms of clearance. The only remedy would be to impose a fine or punishment; but that would not reverse the detrimental consequences on the environment.<br /><br />Suggestion-- Roll back on this increase in the period for filing compliance reports and decrease the period further to 4 months thus requiring the submission of 3 compliance reports every year.</p>',

We are deeply concerned that this draft notification has been put out in the midst of a national health crisis. As you are aware, most of the country is under lockdown and there are severe restrictions on movement in public places. Most offices are closed and staff are working from home. These restrictions may be indefinite and it is not clear when public life and work can resume.</p><p>The long-term public health, social and economic impacts of this global pandemic are yet to be ascertained. The EIA notification is an important regulation through which the impacts of land use change, water extraction, tree felling, pollution, waste and effluent management for industrial and infrastructure projects are to be studied and used in developmental decision-making. Any change in this law has a direct bearing on the living and working conditions of people and the ecology.</p><p>Therefore, it is critical that the government provides suitable and adequate opportunity for those impacted or likely to be affected by the design and implementation of EIA notification. Opportunities to understand and discuss the implications of the proposed amendments may be severely hindered due to the present health emergency with restricted public movement, social distancing and challenges to everyday life activities. These restrictions also make it impossible to disseminate information about the notification to communities who deserve to know and influence the notification.</p><p>We therefore request the environment ministry to:</p><ul><li>Immediately, withdraw the proposed amendments of the Draft EIA notification 2020.</li></ul><ul><li>Consider reissuing the draft only after health conditions related to Covid-19 and civic life is normalized across the country.</li></ul><ul><li>Ensure that there are wide spread and informed public discussions on the implication of these amendments.</li></ul><ul><li>A full disclosure of the nature of comments received and the reasons for acceptance and rejection of these comments, prior to the issuance of the final amendments.</li></ul><p>We do hope that the environment ministry will uphold its obligations towards informed public participation like the commitment to Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration and also the Principles of Natural Justice, while taking a considered view on the proposed amendments to the EIA notification, 2020.</p><p>Sincerely</p><p>A Concerned Citizen</p><p>Copy to:</p><ul><li>Geeta Menon, Jt Secy, MoEFF (menong@cag.gov.in)</li></ul><p>Official email ID for responses to Draft EIA 2020: (eia2020-moefcc@gov.in)</p><p>sources:https://cprindia.org</p><p><br /><br /></p>',

Currently, the notification is at the stage of public comments. I understand that the new notification is being brought in order to make the process more transparent and expedient.<br /><br />However, I, as a citizen and a participant of Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan, have concerns over it.</div><div>1. The new notification includes certain provisions which could end up diluting the EIA process, especially the <strong>public consultation aspect.</strong> It provides for a <strong>reduction of time period from 30 days to 20 days for the public to submit their responses during a public hearing for any application seeking environmental clearance</strong>. <strong>It also requires that the public hearing process be completed in 40 days compared to 45 days under the 2006 notification</strong>. The main reason stated for reducing the time is that it would become easy for new investments to complete the formality of EIA.<br /><br />- The danger is that if adequate time is not given for the preparation of views, comments and suggestions to those who would be affected by the project, then such public hearings would not be meaningful. </div><div>- In the Samarth Trust Case, the Delhi high court had considered EIAs a part of participatory justice in which the voice is given to the voiceless and it is like a jan sunwai, where the community is the jury.</div><div>- Unless a public hearing is meaningful, the whole EIA process would lack transparency and credibility. <strong>The reduction of time would particularly pose a problem in those areas where information is not easily accessible or areas in which people are not that well aware of the process itself. </strong>As the Supreme Court has said in several judgements over the years, the time for making any representation should be adequate and if it is not, then it would be a violation of the principles of natural justice.<br />- Even though the notification provides for the dissemination of information relating to public hearings through newspapers (and where dissemination through newspapers is not possible then by beating of drums or through radio or TV), the problem still remains. <strong>The issue of concern here is not the notice for public hearing but the access to information on which the affected people need to comment.</strong><br /><br />2. <strong>The project is allowed to start first and get an EIA clearance later.</strong> This will allow for unmonitored destruction of the environment and will pose a huge threat to the residing communities.</div><div>3. <strong>Loosened regulations: </strong>Rather than twice a year, the industries will have to now report compliance only once a year. Industries will be allowed to prepare reports themselves. There are high chances for them taking any and all measures in the name of development that will destroy the already disrupted environment. </div><div>4. <strong>Clearance exemption: </strong>If the clearance exemption clause is still provided, communities that will be affected by coal mining, petrochemical plants, irrigation or waterway projects will no longer be able to report industrial violations. In turn, again destroying the environment, forests and wildlife. </div><div>5. <strong>Fines in place of criminal implications: </strong>Small fines in place of criminal implications will give a leeway for industries to continue with their violations and destruction of the environment and its resources by just paying a small fine. </div><div>6. <strong>No public participation for dams, mining and highway expansion: </strong>Such projects no doubt are essential for development but if the communities residing around them, or the forest and the wildlife surrounding the projects are being affected at alarming rates, there will not be any grievance redressal. It takes away the rights of vulnerable communities. If forests and wildlife are being affected by them, there will be no grievance redressal.</div><div>In conclusion, all these new norms give free and easy access to industries to damage our already affected environment, threatened forests and wildlife and takes away the rights of the vulnerable communities, forests or wildlife affected by them. In the wake of this pandemic, we should be more thoughtful and considerate about our environment .</div><div><br /><strong>Suggestions:</strong></div><div>- Rather than compromising on the time needed for gathering public opinion, the government should focus on bringing down the average delay of 238 days in granting environmental clearance.

However, the new notification requires the promoter to submit a report only once every year. During this period, certain irreversible environmental, social or health consequences of the project could go unnoticed because of the extended reporting time.

Any hazardous activity can then be stopped through timely reporting.<br /><br />However, providing a longer period for filing reports can lead to disastrous consequences.

The new notification is being brought in order to make the process more transparent and expedient by implementation of an online system, further delegation, rationalisation and standardisation of the process.<br /><br /><br /><div>1. The new notification includes certain provisions which could end up diluting the EIA process, especially the <strong>public consultation aspect.</strong> It provides for a <strong>reduction of time period from 30 days to 20 days for the public to submit their responses during a public hearing for any application seeking environmental clearance</strong>. <strong>It also requires that the public hearing process be completed in 40 days compared to 45 days under the 2006 notification</strong>. The main reason stated for reducing the time is that it would become easy for new investments to complete the formality of EIA.<br /><br />- The danger is that if adequate time is not given for the preparation of views, comments and suggestions to those who would be affected by the project, then such public hearings would not be meaningful. </div><div>- In the Samarth Trust Case, the Delhi high court had considered EIAs a part of participatory justice in which the voice is given to the voiceless and it is like a jan sunwai, where the community is the jury.</div><div>- Unless a public hearing is meaningful, the whole EIA process would lack transparency and credibility. <strong>The reduction of time would particularly pose a problem in those areas where information is not easily accessible or areas in which people are not that well aware of the process itself. </strong>As the Supreme Court has said in several judgements over the years, the time for making any representation should be adequate and if it is not, then it would be a violation of the principles of natural justice.<br />- Even though the notification provides for the dissemination of information relating to public hearings through newspapers (and where dissemination through newspapers is not possible then by beating of drums or through radio or TV), the problem still remains. <strong>The issue of concern here is not the notice for public hearing but the access to information on which the affected people need to comment.</strong><br /><br />2. <strong>The project is allowed to start first and get an EIA clearance later.</strong> This will allow for unmonitored destruction of the environment and will pose a huge threat to the residing communities.</div><div>3. <strong>Loosened regulations: </strong>Rather than twice a year, the industries will have to now report compliance only once a year. Industries will be allowed to prepare reports themselves. There are high chances for them taking any and all measures in the name of development that will destroy the already disrupted environment. </div><div>4. <strong>Clearance exemption: </strong>If the clearance exemption clause is still provided, communities that will be affected by coal mining, petrochemical plants, irrigation or waterway projects will no longer be able to report industrial violations. In turn, again destroying the environment, forests and wildlife. </div><div>5. <strong>Fines in place of criminal implications: </strong>Small fines in place of criminal implications will give a leeway for industries to continue with their violations and destruction of the environment and its resources by just paying a small fine. </div><div>6. <strong>No public participation for dams, mining and highway expansion: </strong>Such projects no doubt are essential for development but if the communities residing around them, or the forest and the wildlife surrounding the projects are being affected at alarming rates, there will not be any grievance redressal. It takes away the rights of vulnerable communities. If forests and wildlife are being affected by them, there will be no grievance redressal.</div><div>In conclusion, all these new norms give free and easy access to industries to damage our already affected environment, threatened forests and wildlife and takes away the rights of the vulnerable communities, forests or wildlife affected by them. In the wake of this pandemic, we should be more thoughtful and considerate about our environment .</div>Suggestion-- rather than compromise on the time needed for gathering public opinion, the government should focus on bringing down the average delay of 238 days in granting environmental clearance.

In the Samarth Trust Case, the Delhi high court had considered EIAs a part of participatory justice in which the voice is given to the voiceless and it is like a jan sunwai, where the community is the jury. <br /><br />Unless a public hearing is meaningful, the whole EIA process would lack transparency and credibility. The reduction of time would particularly pose a problem in those areas where information is not easily accessible or areas in which people are not that well aware of the process itself. As the Supreme Court has said in several judgements over the years, the time for making any representation should be adequate and if it is not, then it would be a violation of the principles of natural justice. <br /><br />Even though the notification provides for the dissemination of information relating to public hearings through newspapers (and where dissemination through newspapers is not possible then by beating of drums or through radio or TV), the problem still remains. The issue of concern here is not the notice for public hearing but the access to information on which the affected people need to comment.<br /><br />Suggestion-- rather than compromise on the time needed for gathering public opinion, the government should focus on bringing down the average delay of 238 days in granting environmental clearance. In Kerala, the administration took 1,049 days to clear the construction of the IT park project of M/s T Tech Park Ltd, instead of 105 days.</p><p>The Earth Is What We Have In Common</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Concerned Earthling and Citizen of the Republic of India</p>'
